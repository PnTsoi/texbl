8/1/2022 - created a git for texbl. The name is a combination of textbook and blog. The website will be a way for students/teachers/ anybody to create their own course about any topics, like a textbook but in blog form. I want this to be a source of knowledge that people can access and learn specifically university level topics. You shouldn't need to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for knowledge. Textbooks are rigorous and often lack foundations for people wanting to learn. Medium.com posts are approachable but provide no tangible continuity for learners to access and read up all the knowledge needed. I'm building a platform that content creator can make something near Terence Tao's quality in his books for real analysis or Vu Huu Tiep's Machine Learning co ban posts: Approachable and formal for all levels, but still provide a very well-laid foundation for the topic. 

A course will be a pipeline of posts. Readers can follow each posts like a lesson and once they finished all the posts, they will read up all of what that creator has to offer. Before joining a pipeline, there will be prerequisites recommending other pipelines by other creators so that readers can prepare the necessary knowledge. Homeworks will be provided by the creators. Discussion sections are online 24/7 group chat that people can ask for help for specific topics and are answered by others.


Creators create based on the interest of sharing knowledge, makng extra money (thru donations, the platform will be free of charge), relearing knowledge, etc.
